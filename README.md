## Overview

I have completed the following challenges:

- **unsubmitted_forms**
- **end_of_week_issue**
- **breakdown_ui**

The solutions for each challenge can be found in their respective folders.  
Alongside the code, I’ve also recorded a Loom video explanation for each, walking through my thought process, the issues I found, and how I approached fixing them.

## Structure

- Each challenge has its own **folder**.
- Inside each folder, you’ll find:
  - The **solution code**.
  - A **Loom video link** explaining the solution.

## Completed Tests

- For **senior roles** → `architecture_challenge`, `unsubmitted_forms`, and `end_of_week_issue`.

In my case, the completed set is:
